  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. global context: the window itself is what this refers to since this refers to the parent of the current function. so global functions when using this refer to windwo
  2. new binding: in an object lets you create new objects and use the current called object as the reference for this. allows you to save on variable creation and use objects as molds for multiple objects of same kind
  3. implicit: methods of an object will use this to imply the object and its attributes
  4. explicit: when you call or otherwise use an objects methods and are binding objects together the this keyword is now being explicit as it is being explicitly defined to mean the called or bound method's object now
